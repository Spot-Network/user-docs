The `List to single value` module is a logic module that allows you to convert a single value into a list of text entries. This node takes a single input value and splits it into a list based on a specified delimiter or paragraph. The delimiter can be any character, such as a comma, space, or custom string.

The module has **one input** and **one output**:

- **Input**: `Text`, the concatenation of the provided list according to the defined separation character
- **Output**: `list of text`, receives a list of text inputs

In the image below, the text list is being transformed into a single output separated by a `-`
