The `Use Search Engine` module allows you to conduct web searches on demand, find flights, hotels, and much more. It functions just like Google, allowing you to enrich your tools with relevant information effortlessly.

**You can use this module to provide live contextual information from different sources to an AI model.**

This module has multiple configurations that can enhance its capabilities.

- **Type of search**: This allows the type of search to be selected.
  - `Web Search` is a traditional google search.
  - `Flights` finds flights on google flights.
  - `Hotels` finds Hotels on google hotels.
  - `Shopping` finds products on google shopping.
  - `Locations` finds locations on google maps.
  - `Science Articles` finds research papers on google scholar.
  - `Images` finds images on google images.
- **Number of retrieved results**: Choose the number of search results to process. Keep in mind that selecting a higher number will increase the time it takes to complete the workflow. The results will be extracted in the order they appear in the search.
- **Output as List**: If enabled, returns the result as a list of items
- **Output as JSON**: If enabled, returns the result as a raw JSON result instead of a formatted markdown
- **Advanced Options**:
  - **Continue on Error**: If enabled, in case the scraping fails, the output value of Text will contain the value `<ERROR>`, instead of failing the workflow

The `Use Search Engine` module has **one input** and **one output**:

- **Input**: `Query`, the request in natural language. For example for Flights, `Lisbon to London on the 13th of August`
- **Output**:
  - `Results`, the results of the searc query in either markdown or JSON format, as previously selected
