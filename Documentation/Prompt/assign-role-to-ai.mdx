title: "Assign a Role to AI"
---

Transforming your AI from a general assistant to a specialized expert is straightforward with Noxus's **Context** prompt. By defining a specific role within the **Context** text box available in all AI modules, you can tailor the AI's expertise, tone, and focus to meet your unique needs.

## Why Assign a Role to Your AI?

- **Enhanced Precision:** Defining a role ensures the AI understands the specific nuances of specialized tasks, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs.
- **Customized Communication:** Whether you require the analytical depth of a financial analyst or the creative flair of a marketing strategist, role assignment adjusts the AI's tone and style accordingly.
- **Focused Responses:** Setting a clear role context keeps the AI aligned with your specific objectives, minimizing irrelevant or off-target information.

## How to Assign a Role Using the Context System Prompt

Utilize the **Context** text box in your AI node to define the AI's role. This **Context** sets the foundational behavior and expertise level of the AI, while all task-specific instructions should be included in the Prompt text box.

## Example Setup

1. **Access the Context Box:** Navigate to your AI node and locate the **Context** text box.
2. **Define the Role:** Enter a clear and specific role prompt that outlines the AI's expertise and perspective.

   **Example:**

   <img height="100" src="/images/Example2.png" />

3. **Add Task-Specific Instructions:** In the Prompt text box, provide the specific instructions for the AI to follow.

   **Example:**

   <img height="200" src="/images/example3.png" />

<Info>
  **Role Assignment Tip:** Experiment with various roles to observe how the AI's
  expertise and perspective adapt. For instance, a data scientist will interpret
  data differently than a marketing strategist, offering insights tailored to
  each domain.

## Examples of Role Prompting

To demonstrate the impact of assigning roles, let's explore two scenarios: one without role prompting and one with a defined role using the **Context**.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legal Contract Review Without Role Assignment">

**User Prompt:**

Analyze this software licensing agreement for potential risks:

<contract>{{ CONTRACT_TEXT }}</contract>

Focus on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership.

**AI Response:**

Here’s a summary of the key points in the software licensing agreement:

1. **Indemnification (Section 8):**

   - We indemnify the vendor against claims arising from our use.

2. **Limitation of Liability (Section 9):**

   - Damages capped at $500.

3. **IP Ownership (Section 12):**
   - We retain ownership of our modifications.

Overall, the agreement seems standard. The indemnification and liability clauses are typical, and we maintain our IP rights.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Legal Contract Review With Role Assignment">

**User Prompt:**

You are the General Counsel of a Fortune 500 tech company. We’re considering this software licensing agreement for our core data infrastructure:

<contract>{{ CONTRACT_TEXT }}</contract>

Analyze it for potential risks, focusing on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership. Provide your professional opinion.

**AI Response:**

I’ve reviewed the software licensing agreement, and I have serious concerns that could expose our company to significant risks:

1. **Indemnification (Section 8):**

   - **Critical Issue:** We indemnify the vendor against “any and all claims” arising from our use.
   - **Risk:** This could hold us liable even for the vendor’s negligence or product defects.
   - **Recommendation:** Reject. Limit our indemnity to claims arising from our violation of the agreement.

2. **Limitation of Liability (Section 9):**

   - **Critical Issue:** Damages capped at $500, including direct damages.
   - **Risk:** Grossly inadequate. A critical failure in our data infrastructure could cost us millions in lost revenue and reputational damage.
   - **Recommendation:** Reject. Negotiate for a cap at 12 months of fees for direct damages, and carve-outs for data breaches.

3. **IP Ownership (Section 12):**
   - **Critical Issue:** Vendor gains joint ownership of our modifications and integrations.
   - **Risk:** They could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights to competitors.
   - **Recommendation:** Reject. We must retain full ownership of our work.

**Professional Opinion:**

Do not sign this agreement. It is grossly unfavorable and exposes us to unacceptable levels of risk. If the vendor refuses to renegotiate these terms, I strongly advise exploring alternative providers or accelerating our in-house solution. The potential costs of proceeding with this agreement far outweigh any short-term gains.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

In this example:

- **Without Role Assignment:** The AI provides a basic analysis of the software licensing agreement, summarizing key sections but missing deeper insights and critical issues that could have significant implications for a large company.

- **With Role Assignment:** By defining the AI as the General Counsel of a Fortune 500 tech company, the AI delivers a thorough and professional analysis. It identifies critical issues, assesses risks, and offers clear recommendations, demonstrating a higher level of expertise and attention to detail.

## Best Practices for Assigning Roles

- **Be Specific:** Clearly define the AI's role in the **Context** text box to ensure it understands its expertise and perspective.
- **Separate Instructions:** Use the **Context** text box solely for role definition. Place all task-specific instructions within the user messages to maintain clarity.
- **Experiment and Iterate:** Test different roles to find the best fit for your tasks. Adjust the role descriptions to fine-tune the AI's performance and output style.
