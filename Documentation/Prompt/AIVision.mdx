The `Interpret Image` module leverages advanced Vision-enabled Language Models to interpret images and provide answers to user-submitted questions. Connect an image and a prompt containing your question, and the model will analyze the visual content to deliver accurate responses.

**You can use this module to identify objects, understand contexts, or extract specific details; it offers a powerful way to interact with and gain insights from any image.**

The `Interpret Image` module has **two inputs** and **one output**:

- **Input**: `Prompt` and `Image`, a prompt containing any specific question or insight you want to take from the image.
- **Output**: `Text`, returns an answer to the request specified in the prompt.
