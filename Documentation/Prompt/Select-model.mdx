title: "Select the right model"
---

Choosing the appropriate AI model is crucial to achieving the best results for your specific tasks.

Our platform offers a diverse range of models, each optimized for different use cases based on key metrics such as quality, output speed, and token window size. This guide will help you understand these metrics and select the most suitable model for your needs.

## Key Metrics to Consider

- **Quality:** Determines how well the model performs the task, including the accuracy and relevance of its responses.
- **Output Speed:** Refers to how quickly the model generates responses, which can be critical for time-sensitive applications.
- **Token Window Size:** The maximum number of tokens (words or characters) the model can process in a single prompt. Larger token windows allow the model to handle more extensive and complex inputs.

## How to Choose the Right Model

### 1. Assess Your Task Requirements

- **Complexity:** More complex tasks, such as in-depth analysis or multi-step problem-solving, may require models with higher quality and larger token windows.
- **Volume of Data:** Tasks involving large datasets or long-form content benefit from models with extended token windows.
- **Response Time:** If your application demands quick responses, prioritize models known for faster output speeds.

### 2. Match Metrics to Task Needs

- **High Quality & Large Token Window:** Ideal for comprehensive reports, detailed analyses, and tasks requiring nuanced understanding.
- **Balanced Quality & Speed:** Suitable for everyday applications like customer support, content generation, and interactive chatbots.
- **Fast Output & Smaller Token Window:** Best for simple queries, real-time interactions, and applications where speed is more critical than depth.
