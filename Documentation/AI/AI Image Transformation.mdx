The `Transform Image` module can use any of the state-of-the-art AI models to generate images from another image and a prompt instruction.

**You can use this module to change the style of your photos, create alternative images of your face, and much more**

The `Transform Image` module has **two inputs** and **one output**:

- **Input**: `Prompt`, describes the image the model should generate, including artistic references and styles.
- **Output**: `Image`, returns the output from the AI model based on the `Prompt` inputs provided.

- **Configs**: `width` and `height` of the image generated
