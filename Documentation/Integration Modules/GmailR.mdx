The `Gmail - Read Emails` pulls emails from your Gmail when you need them, based on what you're looking for.

**This is particularly useful when you want to pull information from your emails to action a workflow or use information from emails as part of the context**

The `Gmail - Read Emails` module has **six outputs**:

- **Outputs**:

  - `Sender`- Email address of the sender
  - `Receiver`- Email address of the receiving party
  - `CC`- Email addresses in CC
  - `Attachment` - Files attached to the email
  - `Date` - Date and time the email was sent
  - `Body` - Content in the body of the email

- **Config**:
  - `Output as JSON`: If enabled, returns the result as a raw JSON result instead of a formatted markdown
  - `Label`- Label of your gmail account associated with the emails to be read
  - `Number of read emails`- Number of emails that should be read
  - `Read Attachments` - Toggle to select wether attachments are read or not in each email
