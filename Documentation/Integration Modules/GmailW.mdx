> **This Module requires that you connect your account to the `Linked Accounts` page. Go to Settings to get this done.**

The `Gmail - Send Email` module allows you to finalize a workflow with an email that can be sent from your Gmail address.

**This is particularly useful when you want to automate email outreach or receive / send reports (e.g., News reports / Competitor reports / Operational reports).**

The `Gmail - Send Email` module has **three inputs**:

- **Input**: Multiple type `text` inputs can be received. The `recipient` represents the email or emails (if it is a list) to which you want to send the email. The `title` means the email's subject, and the `body` represents the body of the email.
- **Config**: If the `draft` button is enabled, emails are kept as drafts in your inbox
