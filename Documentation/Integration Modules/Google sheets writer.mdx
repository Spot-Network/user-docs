The `Google Sheets - Write in Columns` module allows you to write data using Google Sheets. 

**Google Sheets are processed by column; you must maintain the first row of the Google Sheets for the headers where each column represents a variable.**

**To better use this module, you should create empty columns in Google Sheets and write the information you have processed in the workflow into those columns**

The `Google Sheets - Write in Columns` module has **variable inputs**:

- **Inputs**: Each column header in the first row of the Google Sheets represents a `variable input` that receives a list to be written in each Google Sheets column.
- **Config**: The Google Sheets file can be loaded with a link or via the Google Finder
