> **This Module requires that you connect your API key in the `Linked accounts` page. Go to Settings to get this done.**

The `Telegram Writer` module allows you to finalize a workflow with a message to telegram.

**This is a particularly more complex node to implement, we refer to telegram's documentation on how to get the chat ID and API keys: [Telegram Docs](https://core.telegram.org/) **

The `Telegram Writer` module has **one input**:

- **Input**: the `text` you want to send to a chat or group
- **Config**: `chat id` of the group or chat
