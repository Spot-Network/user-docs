A `Gmail trigger` interface allows users to run workflows seamlessly when an email is sent.

The `Gmail trigger` function has the following configs and inputs:

- **Label**: Specify the label and folder from which you want emails to be read from
- **Keyword**: Define a Keyword that, once mentioned in an email, will trigger the workflow
- **Inputs**: Define the input component of the email that should be passed onto the workflow

Take, for example, this trigger set to run every Thursday at 2 pm.
