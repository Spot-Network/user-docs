Description: "This trigger allows users to start a workflow at a given time of the day, month, and week."
---

A `Schedule trigger` interface allows users to run workflows seamlessly at any time of the day, week, and month.

**You can use this feature to run a workflow automatically during the night so that you can have the work done in the morning**

The `Schedule Trigger` function has the following configs and inputs:

- **Frequency**: Specify the frequency of the trigger on an hour, daily, weekly, and monthly cadence
- **Time Specification**: Define the exact time at which the workflow should run
- **Inputs**: Define the input that should trigger the workflow

Take, for example, this trigger set to run every Thursday at 2 pm.
