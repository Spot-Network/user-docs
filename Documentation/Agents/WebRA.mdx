The `Web Research` module searches multiple websites to compile a report on a particular topic.

**You can use this module to provide live contextual information from a particular topic or even to perform a report that an LLM can use to improve its results**

The `Web Research` module has **one input** and **one output**:

- **Input**: `Goal`, this is a text input describing your objective with the research
- **Output**: `Summary`, an analysis based on the web research

- **Configs**:
  - `Depth`, defines the level of depth of the research, the more in-depth the research, the longer the node will take
  - `Context`, The `Context` describes the behavioral information in detail. This will help the researcher select the right information and present it in a more relevant way
  - `Time Awareness`, When enabled, the node will automatically convert mentions of time periods (e.g., 'next week', 'next month') into specific dates, ensuring higher accuracy and reliability.
