>**This Module requires connecting your API key to the `Linked accounts` page. Go to Settings to get this done.**

The `Telegram Writer` module allows you to finalize a workflow with a telegram message. 

**This is a particularly more complex node to implement; we refer to Telegram's documentation on how to get the chat ID and API keys: [Telegram Docs](https://core.telegram.org/) **

The `Telegram Writer` module has **one input**:

- **Input**: the `text` you want to send to a chat or group
- **Config**: `chat ID` of the group or chat
