The `Extract Information` module is a logic module that can extract important information from a text block. This module is particularly useful when extracting key variables from a text to store in a spreadsheet or database

**You can use this module to parse a complex output and extract relevant information for the workflow**

The `Extract Information` module has **one input** and **variable outputs**:

- **Input**: `text`, receives any text input
- **Output**: `Text`, can have unlimited text outputs; each output requires a proper description as those are leveraged by the AI agent to find the right information.

In this module, you can also use `Advanced Options` to select the AI model you want to use. Please find here a comparison of the models we provide: [Model Comparison](/content/text)

In the image below, the input is being parsed into two outputs: Name and age
