The `Filter List` module is a logic module that can Filter values based on a specific condition or ask AI to filter it for you. This module is particularly useful when removing content from a list that fits a certain condition. 

The `Filter List` module has **one input** and **one output**:

- **Input**: `list`, receives any list
- **Output**: `list`, the list filtered out according to the defined condition.

In this module, there are two `Configurations`:

- **AI Condition**: This allows you to use AI to filter your values. All you have to do is describe the filter condition, `E.g., Exclude all values written in Portuguese.`
- **Value Type**: This allows you to select the type of value you are filtering, whether it is `Number` or `Text`, and apply specific conditions to each type
