The `List to single value` module is a logic module that allows you to convert a list of text entries into a single value. This module is particularly useful for transforming a list of text read from a Google sheet into a text you can pass in a single prompt.

The module has **one input** and **one output**:

- **Input**: `list of text`, receives a list of text inputs
- **Output**: `Text`, the concatenation of the provided list according to the defined separation character

In the image below, the text list is being transformed into a single output separated by a `-`
