The `Combine Text` module is fundamental for creating workflows; it mostly combines multiple inputs and forms a more text output. 

This is particularly useful when writing more complex prompts.

The `Combine Text` module has **variable inputs** and **one output**:

- **Input**: Can receive multiple inputs of type `text`; these can be used as a dynamic input inside the prompt of the Combine Text module. Just press `+` to add as many inputs as you want.
- **Output**: `text`, the output is the prompt combined with the dynamic inputs.

Below is an example of `Combine text` being used to compose a prompt for a fitness workflow:

In this example, each of the **six inputs** can be positioned in the text prompt as variables. 

In the text prompt, each input is represented as a variable inside brackets like these: `(( ))`

Combining text enables more complex workflows that utilize multiple layers of agents and AI models. For example:
