## 1. What is it?

The workflow builder is one of the core tools in Noxus's platform. This is where you build, run, deploy, and share your AI workflows and tools.

To access the workflow builder, click "Create New Flow" on the page "My flows".

The workflow builder comprises the **Navigation Bar** - where you can find all the components to build your workflow - and the **Top Bar** - where you can Run and Publish your workflow.

## 2. Navigation Bar

The Navigation Bar is the library of modules aggregated by key functionality. Each module in the workflow builder is documented with a detailed explanation of their behavior.

- **Data Modules** 🗂️: These modules allow you to transform and import data of multiple types and sources
- **Logic Modules** 🧩: These modules are designed to help you build more complex workflows by combining sub-flows and actions with logical steps
- **AI Modules** 🧠: Includes state-of-the-art text, image and audio AI models
- **Integration Modules** 🔗: Including integrations with tools such as Gmail, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Airtable, Notion, Confluence, and others
- **Agent Modules** 🤖: Our in-house built agents help you perform specific tasks automatically and with much better performance

## 3. Builder canvas

The builder canvas is where you can let your creativity flourish and build automation that makes your life 10x more efficient and productive.

You can connect modules with the same data types together. Just take this very basic example:

You can then take things further to build more advanced workflows that perform much better than traditional agents and models. 

Take, for example, this more complex workflow that uses two different agents to learn complex concepts from books and the Internet:

## 4. Run

The Run page allows you to test your workflow and understand if it outputs the expected actions or results.

## 5. Publish

Once you build and test your workflow, you can have multiple ways to interact with it. 

You can run it on a public web link and share it with your co-workers and friends, or you can run it on any of your favorite apps like WhatsApp, Slack, and MS Teams.
