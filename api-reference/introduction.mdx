The API of Noxus exposes a set of operations for authenticated clients to interact with core entities in the platform, particularly:

- Workflows
- Runs
- Knowledge Bases

Before interacting with any of the concepts it's howver necessary to understand the access mechanism and the organizational structure of the platform.

### Organizational Structure in Noxus

In the Noxus platform, any resource within an organization is associated with an workspace. Any action executed through the API will run in the context of a specific workspace.

1. **Workspaces**:

   An organization is divided into multiple **workspaces**, each functioning as an independent area to manage flows, runs, and other resources. Workspaces help segregate projects, teams, or environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

2. **Members and Roles**:

   Members are assigned to workspaces, where they have specific roles that define their permissions and access levels. This role-based system ensures secure and streamlined collaboration.

3. **Personal Workspaces**:

   Every member has a **personal workspace**, providing a private space for individual tasks and experimentation. Members can also join and collaborate in other workspaces within the organization.

### Authentication

Authentication in the Noxus platform is performed using an API key. To generate an API key, navigate to **Settings > Organization > Workspaces > API Keys** in the dashboard. An API key is always associated with one workspace, with full permissions.

<Note>
  Be careful when sharing access to an API key, as it will grant access to all
  the resources in the workspace with full permissions.
</Note>

Include the API key in your requests by adding it to the header as follows:

```json
X-API-KEY: <your-api-key>
```
